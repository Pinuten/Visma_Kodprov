# VismaSpcs Recruitment Assignment

Code test for Visma where I was tasked to retrieve data from a REST API. I chose SMHIâ€™s API (Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute).

Clone the repo, cd into `VismaSpcs.Recruitment.Rest`, and run:

```bash
dotnet run
```
To run the tests, cd into Visma.Tests and run:

```bash
dotnet test
```
